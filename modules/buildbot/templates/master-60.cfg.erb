####### STATUS TARGETS

# 'status' is a list of Status Targets. The results of each build will be
# pushed to these targets. buildbot/status/*.py has a variety to choose from,
# including web pages, email senders, and IRC bots.

####### PROJECT IDENTITY

# installation's html.WebStatus home page (linked to the
# 'titleURL') and is embedded in the title of the waterfall HTML page.

# the 'buildbotURL' string should point to the location where the buildbot's
# internal web server (usually the html.WebStatus page) is visible. This
# typically uses the port number set in the Waterfall 'status' entry, but
# with an externally-visible host name which the buildbot cannot figure out
# without some help.

c['buildbotURL'] = "http://<%= @fqdn %>:8010/"

####### DB URL

    # This specifies what database buildbot uses to store its state.
    # You can leave this at its default for all but the largest installations.
